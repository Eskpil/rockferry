## Not production ready

Rockferry is a modern vm orchestration platform. It aims to deliever a robust foundation for virtual private cloud providers. It wraps around
[libvirt](https://libvirt.org), a great tool for working with KVM virtual machines.

## Goals

- Support vxlans
- Support multiple storage backends
- OpenID authentication
- Node registration service
- Clustering functionality

- Orchestrate kubernetes clusters with talos?

## Features so far

- Use Ceph as storage backend
- Create vms through ui
- Somewhat sync already existing libvirt installations
